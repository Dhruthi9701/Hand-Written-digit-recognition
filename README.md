**🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition**	

This project implements a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and an OpenCV-based interface allows users to draw digits and see real-time predictions.

**🔧 Technologies Used**	

Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

**🚀 Features**		

Trainable neural network model using MNIST dataset
Interactive canvas for drawing digits
Real-time digit prediction using a trained model
Model saving and loading with .keras format

**📁 Files**

main.py: Trains and saves the digit recognition model
identification.py: Loads the model and provides a drawing interface for predictions

**🖱️ How to Use**

Run main.py to train and save the model
Run identification.py to launch the drawing interface
Draw a digit using the left mouse button and see the predicted result
Right-click to clear the canvas
